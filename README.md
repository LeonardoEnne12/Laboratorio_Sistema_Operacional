# Operating System Laboratory <h1>

Repository created to explore and demonstrate concepts related to operating systems, focusing on waveform simulations and FPGA operations.

### Content: <h3>

* **Compiler:** This folder contains scripts and files related to compilation, meaning here the generation of a binary from a C-minus code is carried out.
* **Laboratorio_SO_FPGA:** This folder seems to be focused on FPGA operations (DE2-115 Altera), meaning here operations are carried out on the processor through binary instructions, and preemption present in operating systems is also performed.
* **Laboratorio_SO_waveform:** This folder seems to be focused on waveform simulations with the same system as the one above but to simulate in Quartus.

### Languages Used: <h3>

* Python (32.7%)
* Verilog (32.3%)
* C (16.2%)
* HTML (8.2%)
